# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The Inventory App is an application that helps the user to maintain control over the inventory with different functions like authentication to log in to the app by using a unique username and password, and add, remove, increase,and decrease elements in the inventory.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The application consists of four screens the first screen includes the authentication screen, the app will include the inventory screen, there would be the third screen with the settings and notifications, and the last screen includes the modification screen.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I approach the development of my code first understanding what my code will need to be able to connect the function and requirements. I like to divide a big project into small tasks that I perfection and run successfully. This process will ensure the development of future projects is successful.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Since I decidedto divide the project into small tasks every part was tested independenly,and making sure that every part was successlly run before moving to the next one, so this helped r the end result since I did not have any problem in the last test. The process has to be organize and precise for the been oustanding in the final result.
